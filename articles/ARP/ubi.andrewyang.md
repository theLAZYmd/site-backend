With the advent of the 2020 election, it worth taking a look at the rarely-seen, oft-pined for, idealist policy of *Universal Basic Income*. The policy reemerges as a staple of the campaign by Democrat presidential candidate Andrew Yang.

Having identified these legitimate possible economic effects, it only remains to evaluate their empirical frequency and the extent of each of their effects. A study conducted in the February of last year reviewed that the effect of the Alaska Permanent Fund on the economic incentives to work appeared to be negligible.

### Definition
- Periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to  all citizens of the US; $1,000 every month

### Positive moral arguments
- Extremely attractive policy
- The moral positive argument - civilised nation might adopt
- Utopian, from each according to their interest
- Positive freedom argument
- Shared possessions argument

### Positive economic arguments
- Lift out of poverty cycle
- Reduces impact of creative destruction
- Supports a greater emphasis on idea-producing economy, backed by the Romer model
- Greater displosable income to power small businesses
- Better working conditions, higher threshold of workplace transgressions, higher job-seeking, reduces stress
- Greater contribution to positive externalities
- Offers chance to escape from debt cycle, decreases power of criminal activity
- Equal opportunity, counters self-perpetuation and slow-starts for children
- Creates a demand for citizenship issues to be resolved

### Negative moral arguments
- The 'reap what you sow' - people should have to work for their money
- Foreign aid argument

### Negative economic arguments
- Improper incentives in the labour market
- Inefficiency in resources distribution

### Neutral (negative)
- The inflation argument (shoe/leather, menu, bureacracy)

### Compare to
- Unemployment benefits systems
- Child benefit
- Pensions

### Case studies
- Alaska Permanent Fund
- Manitoba, Canada
- India trials
- Finnish 2-year trial
- Utrecht, Netherlands

### Conclusion
- If inflation argument is true then it is damning. The argument on improper incentives is also strong if true. Analyse case studies. Otherwise, assuming that inflation shall not occur and incentives are properly maintained, the programs has an extremely large number of positives that outweight the inefficiency argument.
