# Food stalls in Malaysian exhibit perfect market forces

## The ‘Hawker’ Stall is a paradoxical model of both perfect competition and perfect monopoly

My annual trips back to my family’s hometown revolve around eating, the staple of Malaysian culture. The best food is never dressed up in the most expensive ingredients with immaculate presentation in lavish settings, as has become the norm of Western fine-dining. Instead it is an underground secret that the tastiest dishes come from ‘hawker centres’, open-seated restaurants with no single kitchen but multiple, independent food stalls vending to consumers. Each serves a local speciality - the *Nasi Lemak* (a rice and peanut dish), *Char Kway Teow* (flat fried noodles), *Wonton Mein* (dumpling noodles) are favourites among frequenters. It’s here that ‘foodies’ travel to experience the best-of Malaysian cuisine; there are several in each town, each one serves high-quality local food, and each is extremely cheap. Yet hawker centres possess not only the appealing property of offering delicious food, but exhibiting two extreme, seemingly contrasting economic phenomena. The first is that trade between hungry customers and food stalls offers an example of consumer-level perfect competition. The second is that the market for drinks could serve as a case study of a monopoly, but it achieves this not through product diffrentiation by exploiting transaction costs.

What is perfect competition and why is it so rare to find an example for goods sold directly to consumers? Typically it exhibits four properties - infinitely elastic demand, no barriers to entry or exit, zero economic profits, and homogeneity. Demand elasticity, the first of these, affects each vendor's ability to set prices. Consider the reaction from the locals if the price of *wonton mein* suddenly rose, say by a markup of a third. There would be outrage. Regular buyers would accuse the stall chefs of greed and a lack of integrity; devotees would seek their *wonton mein* from elsewhere; and others would simply purchase a different selection from the dishes on offer. Not such a good result for the stall vendor. We describe this as demand that is *infinitely elastic*. Elasticity concerns the proportionate change in quantity sought by the buyers for a given change in price. When this value is infinite, notably with a neegative correlation, any slight shift in the increase in price causes firms to see a demand of zero. By consequence, any fall in price leads to surge in its number of prospective customers. We call this price-*taking* behaviour. No single firm is able to increase its price independently; it simply accepts the going market rate for their particular cuisinary good.

What then determines the price at which this trade occurs? This can be realised by considering the benefits vs costs of lowering prices. Obviously, a stall only wants to sell lower if it is profitable to do so. If the *wonton* stall can attract another 50 customers to its usual 200 a day then surely it seems desirable to do so. But say in order to achieve such a goal, the price of the dish has to fall from 30 *ringgit* to 20.
