- Supports a greater emphasis on idea-producing economy, backed by the Romer model
- Greater displosable income to power small businesses

### Negative moral arguments
- The 'reap what you sow' - people should have to work for their money
- Foreign aid argument

### Negative economic arguments
- Improper incentives in the labour market
- Inefficiency in resources distribution

### Neutral (negative)
- The inflation argument (shoe/leather, menu, bureacracy)

Otherwise, assuming that inflation shall not occur and incentives are properly maintained, the programs has an extremely large number of positives that outweight the inefficiency argument.
